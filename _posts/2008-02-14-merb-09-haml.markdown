title: merb 0.9 & haml
---
I'm currently playing around w/ [merb](http://merbivore.com/) 0.9, and using [haml](http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/).  Trust me things are not starting off super smoothly.  But, I am enjoying using something new, something that's changing daily; reminds me of when I first started using Rails, and all the frustration of not being able to figure something out, followed by the joy when it worked.

That said, there will probably be quite of few posts dealing with all the things that hang me up along the way, so that I have a place to come back to in the future to find the answers.

It appears as though there used to be a file called dependencies.rb (before I tried Merb).  In this file you'd specify what dependencies your app needed, using something like:

    dependencies "RedCloth", "merb_helpers"
or

    dependency "RedCloth"

That was changed, and would then declare your app's dependencies in `config/init.rb`.  Apparently, since yesterday that has changed again slightly.  You still declare your dependencies in `config/init.rb`, but instead of going in the body of the file, it now goes in the `after_app_loads` code block, as such:

    Merb::BootLoader.after_app_loads do
      ### Add dependencies here that must load after the application loads:
      require "merb-haml"
    end

Some might have noticed that you no longer call the `dependency` method, but just plain old `require`.
