When I put this blog up, I had all the intentions in the world to really use it.  I wanted to write about all the cool/interesting/weird things I'd discovered.  But, that is definitely not what has happened.  But, I really want to start using it more.

I have ideas for things to write about.  I recently attended [acts_as_conference](http://actsasconference.com), I really enjoyed it, and even learned a little in the process.  I've been attending the [Orlando Ruby Users Group](http://orug.org) (orug) meetings for a while now, and presented at the last one.  What I've learned from these activities are just some of the things I want to write about on here.
