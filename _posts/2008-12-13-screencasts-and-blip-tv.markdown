So, I've been kicking around the idea of making some screencasts for some time.  When I did my last presentation at [ORUG](http://orug.org), instead of doing a live demo, I used pre-recorded videos; I did this for a couple reasons, one to tip my toes in screencasts and two, instead of everyone there having to suffer through the mistakes I would inevitably make, I could edit out all my mistakes.

I always intended to put those videos online somewhere, but never did.  Main reason was that those videos were intended for use at a presentation, and therefore did not include audio to explain what I was doing; because, I explained what was happening in the videos in the presentation. /rant

Fast forward to today, I still haven't made any other screencasts and my blog has been fairly stagnant as well.  I'm hoping to change both of those problems.  I have some ideas for screencasts and how I want to make them.  In order to make the screencasts the way I want to I need new software. So, I made a test screencast using a demo version of an application [(ScreenFlow)](http://www.telestream.net/screen-flow/overview.htm), and then uploaded it to [blip.tv](http://jswanner.blip.tv/#1581059) to see how it would look.  Below is an embed of the same video.  So, hopefully I'll get off my butt and actually make the real screencasts I've been rambling about.

ï»¿Update:  After creating the last video and making the blog post, I realized that the makers of iShowU make a new product, [iShowU HD](http://www.shinywhitebox.com/ishowuhd/main.html), which does allow me to use iSight to add a video of myself.  Below is an embed to a video using that software.
